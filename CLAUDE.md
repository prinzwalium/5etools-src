# CLAUDE.md — project orientation for AI sessions

This repository is a **fork of 5etools-src**. Its distinguishing customization
is a **Character Sheet builder** (a full, data-driven D&D character
builder/sheet) that upstream 5etools does **not** have.

When helping with this repo, prioritize keeping that builder working and keeping
the fork easy to update from upstream.

## Character Sheet: file map

The feature is **three pages** that share one character store: a play-focused
**sheet** (`charactersheet.html`), a build-focused **builder**
(`charbuilder.html`), and a DM-focused **sidekick builder** (`sidekick.html`).
All three subclass `CharacterPageBase`
(`charactersheet-pagebase.js`), which owns the model, the multi-character
store/switcher, autosave, file save/load, the null-safe input binding, the
print/PDF preparation, and the shared build helpers (data pickers, wizard).
Each page's controller keeps only its own DOM assembly + rendering.

**Fork-owned (upstream has no version → these never conflict on an upstream merge):**
- `charactersheet.html`, `charbuilder.html`, `sidekick.html` — **generated**, do not hand-edit (see below)
- `js/charactersheet.js`, `js/charbuilder.js`, `js/sidekick.js` — the three page entry points
- `js/charactersheet/*.js` — the shared modules: pure rules (`derive`,
  `levelengine`, `choices`, `abilityscores`, `equipment`, `actions`, `charstore`,
  `defenses`, `sidekick`, `citations`, `journal`, `portrait`, `sync`, `buildsteps`,
  `levelpreview`, `consts`),
  data access (`classdata`), the model (`model`), the page
  base (`pagebase`), the shared panel re-render (`panelrender`), and the panel renderers (`classpanel`, `originpanel`, `inventorypanel`,
  `spellspanel`, `actionspanel`, `auditpanel`, `wizard`, `buildwalk`)
- `css/charactersheet.css`, `scss/charactersheet.scss` (shared by all three pages)
- `node/generate-pages/template/page/template-page-charactersheet.hbs`,
  `.../template-page-charbuilder.hbs`, `.../template-page-sidekick.hbs`
- `test/jest/CharacterSheet*.test.js` — unit tests for the pure modules
- `test/e2e/` — browser tests driving the real pages (see `test/e2e/README.md`)
- `.github/workflows/` — `charactersheet-ci.yml`, `sync-upstream.yml`, and
  `docker-image.yml` (the `:latest` / `:beta` image build). Upstream ships only
  `main.yml` and `pages.yml`; leave those alone.
- `js/deploy-defaults.js`, `docker/inject-defaults.sh`, `docker/entrypoint.sh`,
  `docker/compose.example.yml` — the deploy-time default book selection
  (`docs/DEFAULT_BOOKS.md`). Split across build and start-up on purpose: the **build**
  injects the two script tags into every page and leaves a world-writable
  `js/deploy-defaults-config.js`; **start-up** only overwrites that one file from
  `DEFAULT_LOAD` / `DEFAULT_DENY` / `DEFAULT_BREW`. That is what lets the container run as a
  non-root user — creating a file in the web root needs permission on the directory, which
  `user: 1000:1000` lacks. Start-up never fails the container: if the write is refused it
  says why and serves the site unconfigured.
- `js/makebrew/makebrew-forkbase.js` + `-feat.js`, `-language.js`, `-background.js` — homebrew
  builders on `makebrew.html`. Upstream's framework (`makebrew-builder-base.js`) covers creatures,
  spells and legendary groups and nothing else; the fork adds its own beside them, registered from
  `js/makebrew.js`. `ForkBuilderBase` holds what is true of every kind — the tab skeleton, the
  rendered-beside-JSON output pane, the load-a-template strip, and the input widgets for the shapes
  the data takes (a set of things, a count, a list of rows). Anything that knows what a feat *is*
  belongs in that builder. The plan for the rest — and for serving what is authored —
  is `docs/HOMEBREW.md` in the **account system**.
- `scripts/` — upstream has no such directory. `update-from-upstream.sh` (the
  preferred way to take an upstream update) and `rehearse-upstream-sync.sh`
  (replays the sync workflow's steps over a synthetic upstream, so the merge and
  conflict paths can be tested without waiting for upstream to move).

**Shared upstream files the fork edits (the ONLY upstream-merge conflict points):**
1. `js/navigation.js` — three `_addElement_li({... page: "….html" ...})` lines
   (`charbuilder.html`, `sidekick.html`, `charactersheet.html`)
2. `index.html` — two `<a href="charactersheet.html">` home-page buttons
   (the sidekick builder is navbar-only, deliberately: it is a DM tool, and
   fewer home-page edits means fewer conflicts)
3. `node/generate-pages/generate-pages-page-generator-config.js` — the
   `_PageGeneratorCharactersheet` / `_PageGeneratorCharbuilder` /
   `_PageGeneratorSidekick` classes + their three
   `new _PageGenerator...(),` registration lines
4. `package.json` — a `test:e2e` script and the `playwright-core` dev dependency (two lines)
5. `Dockerfile` — an `ENTRYPOINT` (plus the `CMD` that setting one discards, and the `RUN` that
   installs it) for the deploy-time default books. Upstream's is two lines.
6. `js/makebrew.js` — four additive one-liners registering the fork's homebrew builders (an
   `import`, a setter, an `<option>`, and the instantiate-and-wire block at the bottom)

### Species

A species' `additionalSpells` is the **same shape a subclass uses** but keyed by *character* level,
and it is granted whether or not the character has a spellcasting class — so the spells panel reads
it beside the classes (`_pGetSpecies`), and `hasSpellcasting` takes an `isOriginCaster` so a Tiefling
Fighter's Thaumaturgy has somewhere to live. `speed` is a number or an object, and a kind given as
`true` means "equal to your walking speed" (`getSpeeds` / `formatSpeeds` in `appearance`) — reading
only `walk` cost thirty-two species the movement that defines them. A creature type has two halves:
`creatureTypes` plus `creatureTypeTags`, "Humanoid (Goblinoid)" (`getCreatureTypeDisplay`). `age` is
`{mature, max}`. `_copy`, `overwrite` and `_versions` never reach us — the race loader runs
`mergeSubraces`, so subspecies arrive pre-merged.

**Reprints, and the 2024 default.** The data says which entries a later printing supersedes, in
`reprintedAs` — 361 PHB spells, 695 items, 65 subclasses, 13 classes, 50 feats, 97 species and
subspecies, and more. `filterReprinted` (in `sources`) drops an entry when its reprint is *also on
offer*, and `_filterBySource` applies it to every picker unless the character opts out
(`isPreferReprints`, default on, in the source filter).

Two properties make this safe. It runs **after** the source filter, so a 2014-only character never
loses anything: the 2024 reprint is not in the list to supersede it. And it only ever drops an entry
whose replacement is present, so everything the 2024 books never reprinted — Artificer, most
subclasses, whole books — stays. That is what makes it different from `SOURCE_MODE_MODERN`, which
drops the 2014 books outright.

A reprint uid is `name|source` except for a **subclass**, which carries its parent class in the
middle (`"Berserker|Barbarian|XPHB|XPHB"`); the name is always first and the source always last, and
a subclass answers to both its `name` and its `shortName`. A `{uid, tag}` reprint into a different
kind of thing never matches, which keeps a dragonmark subrace pickable. Search-driven pickers
(species, background, item) get `getSupersededKeys` instead, because a search document carries no
`reprintedAs`.

### Backgrounds

Two things a background says that nothing was reading. **`additionalSpells`** — the ten Ravnica
guild and five Strixhaven college backgrounds widen the *learnable* list (`expanded`, keyed `s0`–`s5`
by the slot that unlocks it, `s0` being cantrips), and the background pick path resolved abilities,
proficiencies and feats but never spells. **`fromFeature`** marks a grant as coming from the
background's feature, and a feature naming more than one feat is offering a **menu**: "the Lucky,
Magic Initiate, or Skilled feat (your choice)" was read as three grants, so Rewarded and Ruined
handed over three feats each. `getGrantedFeats(feats, {fromFeature})` returns nothing in that case
and `getGrantedFeatChoice` returns the menu; a background with no `fromFeature` that names two
things (Haunted One: Survivor **and** a Dark Gift) is correctly left granting both.
`_copy` (26 backgrounds) is resolved at load time and never reaches us.

### Feats

`checkFeatPrerequisites` reads eleven of the fourteen prerequisite keys; the three
it cannot are `campaign`, `other` and `otherSummary`, which are prose or a setting,
and report `unknown` rather than blocking. Four are worth knowing about:
**`proficiency`** (`{armor: "medium"}`, `{weapon: "martial"}`, `{weaponGroup: …}`) —
both sides use the same small vocabulary, normalised rather than curated;
**`feature`** — a class feature by name ("Fighting Style", "Pact Magic");
**`featCategory`** / **`exclusiveFeatCategory`** — the dragonmark rules, one
requiring a feat of that category and the other forbidding a second.
A feat can land in four places (an ASI slot, a feature grant, a background, a DM's
gift), and `getTakenFeats` collects all of them — reading only the ASI slots meant a
background's feat satisfied nothing. **`weaponProficiencies`** may be a
`{choose: {fromFilter}}` (Weapon Master, alone): the filter names weapon
*categories*, which `getWeaponChoices` reads and `pGetBaseWeapons` offers.
`repeatableHidden` is a display flag on `repeatable`; `_versions` (Magic Initiate's
per-class forms) are expanded into separate entities by `DataLoader`, so pickers get
them for free.

Exact snippets and resolution steps: `docs/CHARACTER_SHEET_MAINTENANCE.md`.
The account-system contract (a *separate* repo): `docs/ACCOUNT_SYSTEM.md`.
That system, and its feature plan: <https://github.com/PrinzWalium/5etools-online>.
The sidekick builder's own user-facing guide: `docs/SIDEKICK_BUILDER.md`.

## Critical gotcha: the page HTML is generated

`charactersheet.html`, `charbuilder.html` and `sidekick.html` are built from their
`node/generate-pages/template/page/template-page-*.hbs` templates by
`node node/generate-pages.js` (run in the Docker/Pages builds). **Editing the
generated `.html` directly is silently overwritten by the build.** To change
the page markup, edit the **template** and regenerate. After editing a
template, run `node node/generate-pages.js` and commit both.

## Architecture notes

- The builder is model-driven: `CharacterModel` (a 5etools `BaseComponent`
  subclass in `charactersheet-model.js`) is the single source of truth. UI
  mutates the model; the model's hooks re-render. Rendering is one-directional.
- Game rules are read from the real data (classes, races, feats, spells, items),
  not hardcoded — except the PHB multiclass spell-slot table, which is a fixed
  core rule in `charactersheet-levelengine.js`.
- The pure rules modules (`derive`, `levelengine`, `choices`, `abilityscores`,
  `equipment`, `actions`, `charstore`, `defenses`, `sidekick`) are unit-tested;
  keep them DOM-free and tested.
- A sidekick is just a character with `isSidekick: true` and a `refCreature`, so
  derivation, the feature timeline, spell slots, the store, autosave and
  save/load all work unchanged. The store is shared but each page lists only its
  own kind (`_isCharacterListed` / `_getNewCharacterState` in the page base).
- The export is **print-to-PDF**, not a generated PDF. Browsers cannot print a
  `textarea`'s overflow or a closed `<details>`, so `_bindPrintPrep` (page base)
  mirrors textarea text into `.cs__print-text`, opens collapsed sections, and
  flags empty panels for hiding before `window.print()`.

## What the feature covers (so you don't rebuild it)

- **Guided Setup** (`charactersheet-wizard.js`): eight steps. The first seven build a *draft* —
  species, class and level, background, ability scores, the choices those ask for, equipment, and a
  review; **Apply** writes it to the sheet. The eighth is different: it runs against the applied
  character and walks everything that could not be decided before it existed — subclass, ability
  score improvements, Expertise, weapon masteries, optional features (Fighting Style, Invocations,
  …), origin feats, spells, hit points. That list is computed by `charactersheet-buildsteps.js`
  (pure, tested) and answered by `charactersheet-buildwalk.js`, which calls the *panels' own*
  pickers rather than growing a second set. The Build Check lists the same things, because both read
  the same rules.
- **What a choice answered is written down.** `choiceLog` (in the model) records which choice, from
  which source, was answered with what, keyed by `getChoiceSignature`. Every path writes it — the
  guide, the species picker, the background picker — and every path reads it. Without it a skill
  carries no provenance, so nothing could tell an answered choice from an unasked one, and the guide
  and the panels each guessed differently.
- **The same proficiency is never granted twice.** A skill records a state, not a count, so a second
  grant lands on a ticked box and the pick is simply lost — a Human Fighter offered Acrobatics by
  both its species and its class could spend two of its three skills on one. `getHeldProficiencyNames`
  (what the character has) and `getFixedProficiencyNames` (what a *picked but unapplied* entity is
  about to hand it, which is the guide's whole draft) subtract from every chooser, and a choice with
  nothing left to offer is spent rather than owed.
- **A granted feat asks its own questions.** Taking Skilled must offer its three skills-or-tools,
  Crafter its three artisan's tools, Musician its three instruments. Tools and languages are
  resolved by `pResolveFeatSkillChoices`, never written into a notes box — a proficiency as prose is
  invisible to everything, exactly as an origin feat as prose was.
- **"Any combination of three skills or tools" is a field, not prose.** It lives in
  `skillToolLanguageProficiencies` (Skilled, a Half-Elf's Skill Versatility, the Custom Background),
  whose `anySkill` / `anyTool` / `anyLanguage` tokens name a *pool* rather than a list. Reading only
  `skillProficiencies` finds nothing there and makes the feat look like prose worth curating — it is
  not. `getSkillToolLanguageChoices` parses it into one mixed pool, and a pick is applied by which
  pool it came from.
- **The tool list comes from the item data, by type code.** `AT`/`INS`/`GS`/`T`
  (`pGetToolProficiencyNames`), never by matching `" Tools"` in the name — that finds Smith's Tools
  and misses every *Supplies*, *Utensils*, instrument and gaming set, 28 of 40 in the base file.
  Item *groups* ("Artisan's Tools" as a category) and magic variants (a *+1 Rhythm-Maker's Drum*)
  are excluded; the static list in `choices.js` is only the fallback.
- **A species' size can be a question.** Thirty offer "Small or Medium" (`size: ["S","M"]`), which
  decides carrying capacity, grappling and squeezing — so it is asked, stored in `size`, and shown
  as the character's size rather than as the species' menu. `creatureTypes` is recorded beside it: a
  Plasmoid is an Ooze, and that decides what can target it.
- **Two feat fields beyond the obvious ones.** `savingThrowProficiencies` is Resilient, and nothing
  else in the books; `bonusSenses` is how a feat *raises* a sense it does not grant. Both were
  unread, so both feats did nothing at all.
- **A `repeatable` feat may be taken twice.** Skilled and Magic Initiate both are. The pickers used
  to filter out anything already held, and `addOriginFeat` deduplicated by name, so a legal second
  take was offered and then dropped.
- **The small panels watch the whole character, not a list of props.** A hook list that misses one
  shows yesterday's answer until a reload, and that caught this feature four separate times (a
  lineage, a class-granted feat, a size, an origin feat), so species, background and the Build Check
  now re-render on any state change via `bindPanelRender` (`charactersheet-panelrender.js`),
  debounced a frame. The big panels — class, inventory, spells — keep explicit lists, because their
  renders load entity data.
- **A level says what it brings before you take it.** `charactersheet-levelpreview.js` is pure —
  derive at N, derive at N+1, subtract — and lists hit points, proficiency bonus, features, slots and
  resources, then what the level will *ask* (ASI, subclass, masteries, cantrips). It reports and
  never writes, which is what lets **Cancel** put the level back and change nothing else. It reads
  both shapes class data takes: the loader's dereferenced features and the files' raw string refs.
- **A feat uid may narrow the feat as well as name it.** `"magic initiate; wizard|xphb"` is Magic
  Initiate taken with the Wizard list; only the part before the semicolon is the name a taken feat is
  stored under. `getGrantedFeats` splits the two (`name`, `subChoice`, `displayName`), which is what
  lets a background's granted feat ever register as taken.
- **Species / Background panels** (`charactersheet-originpanel.js`, on the sheet and the builder):
  what the entity grants — proficiencies, ability increases, senses and resistances, origin feats —
  each **ticked against what the character actually has**, what is still to choose with the button
  that chooses it, and its traits as cards. A **"choose one of the following" trait** (Elven Lineage,
  Draconic Ancestry, Giant Ancestry, Fiendish Legacy) is one of those questions, not a trait card:
  the guide asks it, the panel asks it, and the Build Check reports it. Origin feats are *applied*,
  never written into a notes box: a feat as prose is invisible to everything that counts.
- **Builder** (`charbuilder.html`): a **Build Check** panel (`charactersheet-audit.js`)
  reporting what breaks a rule and what is unclaimed; guided wizard; species/background/class pickers;
  ability scores; the class/leveling panel (subclass, ASI/feat with prerequisite
  warnings, optional features, **Expertise** chooser, features timeline); the
  class-filtered **spell manager** (learnable-only, known vs prepared counts,
  ritual flags); real inventory with equip/attune; HP-on-level-up policy.
  Feat skill/Expertise **choices are resolved interactively**.
- **Sheet** (`charactersheet.html`): the play view — abilities/saves/skills,
  **computed Armor Class** (armor/shield/unarmored modes + magic bonuses),
  attacks with a **Wield** button and an automatic **Unarmed Strike**, an
  **Actions** panel (action/bonus/reaction economy), spell slots, death saves,
  **rests** (short/long), and a **conditions & concentration** tracker.
  **Exhaustion** applies the 2024 −2/level to every d20 test (checks, saves,
  skills, initiative, passive Perception, weapon and spell attacks — never a
  save DC or damage); ability boxes therefore expose both `mod` and `checkMod`.
  Losing hit points while concentrating raises a **concentration-save prompt**
  (DC 10 or half the damage) from a `hpCur` hook in the page base.
  Inventory rows track **charges** (spent per click; a rest restores what the
  item's `recharge`/`rechargeAmount` say, rolled) and **ammunition** (*Fire*,
  plus the recover-half-after-a-battle rule).
  The **Actions panel is a turn helper**: `charactersheet-availability.js` grades
  each entry against live state (slots, charges, ammo, concentration,
  conditions) and the panel greys the blocked ones with their reason.
- An ability increase that was **skipped** becomes a `pendingAbilityOffers`
  entry rendered beside the scores, not a note in a box — *Assign now* re-walks
  the original packages. Old characters' notes migrate into offers on load
  (`getStateWithMigratedAbilityNotes`, in `charstore`).
- **Sidekick builder** (`sidekick.html`, navbar → Dungeon Master): a DM tool
  covering **both** sidekick rulesets, read from data in each case.
  - *Essentials Kit*: pick a **type** (Expert/Spellcaster/Warrior) and it seeds
    the sheet from that ESK stat block; pick the **role** the block asks for
    (healer/mage, attacker/defender) and it filters which of the block's entries
    apply and sets the spellcasting ability. The `Sidekicks|ESK` variantrule's
    three tables drive a **level-up box**: exact HP maximum + the level's
    features, applied on a click, plus a "catch up to level N" for a sidekick
    that started high.
  - *Tasha's*: pick any bestiary creature + one of the three TCE sidekick
    classes, and the ordinary class panel drives the 1–20 feature timeline and
    spell slots. This is also the path past ESK's 6th-level ceiling.
  - **Traits & Actions** is a list of editable rows (kind, name, text) with an
    Add button — seeded per stat-block entry, tagged when a level granted it.
  - Every seeded value stays hand-editable; nothing is locked.
- **Every number cites its rule**: a breakdown popover lists one contribution per
  line, and beside each is the rule that lets it count — clicking shows the book's
  own text with its source and page. `charactersheet-citations.js` holds the
  catalogue (the 2024 glossary states Proficiency, Armor Class, Passive Perception
  etc. as addressable `variantrule` entries, so almost nothing is curated); a part
  names its own rule in `derive.js` rather than anything guessing from the label.
  A bonus with two possible causes stays unlinked instead of picking one.
- **Accounts are a seam, not a feature here.** `charactersheet-sync.js` holds the
  adapter contract and the mount path (configurable; default `/online`); the page
  base loads `<base>/client.js` in `pInit` and keeps `window.CharacterSyncAdapter`
  only if it implements the whole contract. The account system itself — OIDC
  against Authentik, sessions, storage — is a **separate repository** behind a
  reverse proxy on the same subdomain. Nothing deployed is a supported state, so
  never make sync a precondition for anything. See `docs/ACCOUNT_SYSTEM.md`.
- **Homebrew** works on all three pages, but only because `pInit` (page base) runs
  `PrereleaseUtil.pInit()` / `BrewUtil2.pInit()` / `ExcludeUtil.pInitialise()` before
  `init()`. `classdata` and `SearchWidget` were always brew-aware; without that
  setup every brew call returns nothing. The *Homebrew* toolbar button opens
  5etools' own `ManageBrewUi`.
- **Appearance** (sheet + builder): age/height/weight/eyes/skin/hair and a
  portrait, built once in the page base so the two cannot drift. A portrait is
  downscaled to 400px and re-encoded before storing (`charactersheet-portrait.js`
  decides the size and is tested); the whole store shares one quota.
- **Session journal** (`charactersheet.html`): the sheet records play as it
  happens — hit points lost and regained, going down, death saves, rests, spent
  slots and class resources, conditions, charges, ammunition, levels — and writes
  each session up as a sentence. `charactersheet-journal.js` is pure: it groups
  events into sessions (a six-hour silence, or an explicit *New session*), infers
  fights from bursts of damage, and summarises. Recording is paused while loading
  (`_setLoading` → `setJournalPaused`), or re-opening the sheet would log the
  restored hit-point total as a fight. Capped at 1000 events, oldest dropped.
- **Reference cards** (`charactersheet.html`, the *Cards* button): the character's
  known spells and attacks printed as index cards, built on demand
  (`charactersheet-cards.js` + `-cardspanel.js`) and visible only on paper. The
  card carries the character's own DC/attack bonus, not a formula.
- **Print / PDF** (all pages, the *Print* button): the browser's print-to-PDF.
  The character pages print as a plain sheet; the sidekick prints as a
  **stat-block card** (small-caps name, red rules, abilities six across,
  full trait/action text, reference tables and controls suppressed).
- **Defenses & senses** (all three pages): resistances, immunities, vulnerabilities,
  condition immunities and senses, read structurally from species/feat/item
  (`charactersheet-defenses.js`) and grouped with their source. Gear's are
  *derived from what is equipped*, never stored; a "choose one" trait's
  resistance is derived from the pick. `getAllDefenses(state)` is the one
  view-level entry point.
- Equipped magic items feed derivations globally: AC, saving throws, spell save
  DC and spell attack, weapon attack/damage, and the defenses above (`derive.js`).
- All three pages share one character store, so a character built in the builder
  is immediately playable on the sheet.

## 5etools class data structure (read this before adding class mechanics)

Almost every class/subclass mechanic the builder needs is **structured data**,
not prose — mining it is how you integrate features correctly. Files:

- `data/class/class-<name>.json` — arrays `class[]`, `subclass[]`,
  `classFeature[]`, `subclassFeature[]`. The `DataLoader` class loader
  **dereferences** the feature refs, so a loaded `cls.classFeatures` is a
  **by-level array of resolved feature objects** (index 0 = level 1). Read via
  `CharacterSheetClassData`, never re-parse refs yourself.
- `data/class/fluff-class-<name>.json` — prose only (`classFluff`, `subclassFluff`).

Key fields (all read by `charactersheet-levelengine.js` unless noted):

- **`classFeatures` refs** are strings `"Name|Class|ClassSource|Level"` (source
  blank ⇒ PHB). A feature that unlocks the subclass is `{classFeature, gainSubclassFeature: true}`.
  2014 subclasses bundle their level features as **nested `refSubclassFeature`
  entries inside one level feature** (e.g. Rakish Audacity lives *inside* the
  level‑3 "Swashbuckler" feature) — collect names recursively
  (`CharacterSheetClassData.pGetCharacterFeatureNames`).
- **`classTableGroups`** = the class table. `colLabels` + `rows` hold per-level
  resource values — **Rages, Rage Damage, Weapon Mastery (count), Sneak Attack,
  Martial Arts die, Ki/Focus/Sorcery Points, Channel Divinity, Wild Shape,
  Bardic Die, Invocations, Favored Enemy**. Cells are strings, numbers, or
  `{type:"dice"|"bonus"|"bonusSpeed"}` (`getClassResources`/`getWeaponMasteryCount`).
  A group with `rowsSpellProgression` is the spell-slot table instead.
- **Spellcasting**: `casterProgression` (`full`/`1/2`/`1/3`/`artificer`/`pact`),
  `cantripProgression`, `spellsKnownProgression`, `preparedSpells` (formula),
  `spellcastingAbility`.
- **`additionalSpells`** — auto-granted domain/patron/circle spells. Array of
  groups with buckets `prepared`/`known`/`expanded`/`innate`, each keyed by
  **class level** → list of uids (`"cure wounds|phb"`) or dynamic
  `{choose}`/`{all}` filters. `getGrantedSpellUids` reads the plain-uid ones.
  The **`innate` bucket wraps its lists in a frequency** — `ritual`, `daily`,
  `rest`, `resource` — which a plain-uid read cannot see into, so it has its own
  reader (`getInnateSpellGrants` + `getInnateSpellCastingNote`). `resource` is
  keyed by **cost** and the group's `resourceName` says what is spent: a Way of
  Shadow monk casts Darkness for 2 Ki Points, never out of a slot.
  The **`expanded` bucket is not a grant** — it is what the character may now
  *learn* — so it is reported as `type: "expanded"` by `getDynamicSpellGrants`
  and merged into the spell browser, never into the always-prepared list.
  Its keys are often **`s1`–`s9`: a spell *slot* level, not a class level** (all
  twelve Warlock patrons, the 2024 Bard's Magical Secrets), resolved against the
  parent class's slot table by `getSlotLevelUnlockLevel` — a subclass has none of
  its own, hence `getDynamicSpellGrants(sc, level, {slotSource: cls})`.
- **`spellsKnownProgressionFixed`** — the Wizard's **spellbook**, `[6, 2, 2, …]`
  being what each level *adds*, so the book is the running total
  (`getSpellbookSize`). Not the prepared count: a Wizard prepares *from* the
  book, and the two are different numbers.
- **`consumes`** — what using a feature spends, on 137 features:
  `{name}` / `{name, amount}` / `{name, amountMin, amountMax}` (Bastion of Law,
  1–5 Sorcery Points). Read by `getFeatureCost`; the name is the book's shorthand
  ("Ki") and the class table's column is the full one ("Ki Points"), so
  `matchResourceLabel` normalises both sides rather than either being curated.
  This is what grades a feature in the turn helper — the old curated
  feature→resource map knew nine names and no subclass at all. The 2024 Psi
  Warrior/Soulknife table heads its columns "Die Size"/"Number" and never names
  the pool, so `getClassResources` names it from the `consumes` of the features
  that spend it.
- **When a feature is taken** is prose, but formulaic: "As a Bonus Action, you
  can spend 1 Focus Point…". `getFeatureActionBucket` reads it for the 56
  features that say so and returns null for the rest rather than guessing a
  rider (Psionic Strike happens on a hit) into the Action column.
- **`spellsKnownProgressionFixedByLevel`** — the Warlock's **Mystic Arcanum**,
  and only that: one 6th-level spell at 11, a 7th at 13, an 8th at 15, a 9th at
  17, each cast at its own level once per long rest. Outside `spellsKnownProgression`
  because a pact caster has no slot that could pay for one.
  `getFixedSpellsKnownGrants` returns them in `getDynamicSpellGrants`' shape, so
  the panel's existing chooser resolves them (`STEP_FIXED_SPELL` in buildsteps).
- **`isClassFeatureVariant`** — Tasha's **optional class features**, referenced
  from `classFeatures` *beside* the features they replace, so reading the list
  naively grants both halves of an either/or (Favored Enemy **and** Favored Foe).
  They are a permission the table gives: opted into per class entry
  (`featureVariants`, `setFeatureVariantForClass`), and what one replaces is read
  from its own italic header rather than curated
  (`annotateVariantFeatures` / `filterActiveFeatures` / `getVariantReplacedNames`
  in `charactersheet-features.js`). `getActiveFeatureTimeline` is the filtered view;
  `getFeatureTimeline` keeps the untaken ones so the builder can offer them.
- **`optionalfeatureProgression`** — counts of Invocations / Maneuvers etc. by
  level (`getOptionalFeatureCounts`). A **feat** writes its progression `{"*": n}`
  — "n of them, whatever your level" — and `Number("*")` is NaN, so a level-indexed
  read returned nothing for all four feats built this way (Martial Adept, Metamagic
  Adept, Eldritch Adept, Fighting Initiate). They hang off a class entry, because
  that is where the model keeps optional features (`pResolveFeatOptionalFeatures`).
- **`featProgression`** — feats the class table grants *by category*: the 2024
  **Fighting Style** (Fighter 1, Paladin 2, Ranger 2, Champion 7) is a feat of
  category `FS` now, not an optional feature, and every class gains an **Epic
  Boon** at 19 (`getFeatProgressionCounts`). The class panel also offers these
  from the feature card that names them, so the guide and the Build Check count
  what was taken **by category**, not by which chooser recorded it.
- **`preparedSpellsProgression`** — the 2024 prepared casters replaced the
  `preparedSpells` formula with an exact by-level table that no longer uses the
  ability modifier. `getPreparedSpellCount` reads whichever the class has;
  reading only the formula left every XPHB prepared caster with no limit at all.
- **`startingProficiencies`** (skills/tools/languages, some as `{choose}`),
  **`startingEquipment`** (`defaultData` A/B groups), **`multiclassing`**.
- Feature *effects* that are only prose (a subclass adding an ability mod to
  Initiative, etc.) can't be read structurally — those use a **small curated map**
  (`charactersheet-features.js`, `charactersheet-actions.js`). Prefer structured
  reads; fall back to curated only for unambiguous prose cases.

Some counts are inconsistent between books (e.g. Weapon Mastery is a table
column for Fighter/Barbarian but prose "two kinds" for Rogue/Ranger/Paladin) —
read the column when present, curated fallback otherwise.

## Updating from upstream

Preferred: `bash scripts/update-from-upstream.sh` (fetches, merges, regenerates
pages, runs Character Sheet lint + tests, makes a safety backup branch). If a
conflict occurs it will be in one of the 4 shared files above — resolve by
keeping BOTH the fork's registration line(s) and upstream's changes, per
`docs/CHARACTER_SHEET_MAINTENANCE.md`.

It also happens nightly, unattended, via `.github/workflows/sync-upstream.yml`.
Read its green tick carefully: on a night when upstream has not moved it skips
everything after its second step, so success means only "nothing to do". To
exercise it for real, dispatch it with `force` (and `dry_run` to keep the result
off `main`), or run `bash scripts/rehearse-upstream-sync.sh clean|conflict`,
which replays its steps over a synthetic upstream in a throwaway clone — the
only way to reach the conflict path deliberately.

## Verifying Character Sheet changes

All three run in CI on every push (`.github/workflows/charactersheet-ci.yml`).

- Lint: `npx eslint js/charactersheet.js js/charbuilder.js js/sidekick.js js/charactersheet/`
- Unit tests (pure modules, ~2s): `npm run test:unit -- test/jest/CharacterSheet`
- Browser tests (the real pages, ~3min): `npm run test:e2e` — starts its own dev server.
  Add one for any behaviour that only exists in the running page; see `test/e2e/README.md`.
- Manual: `npm run serve:dev` then open `http://localhost:5050/charactersheet.html`
  (or `/charbuilder.html`, `/sidekick.html`; regenerate first if you changed a template).
- `npm install` may need `--engine-strict=false` if the local Node is older than
  the repo's `engines` requirement.
